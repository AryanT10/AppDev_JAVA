Introduction

In this workshop, we were tasked with creating a Java application to manage and display information about musical instruments.
The primary objectives included receiving input for instrument prices, displaying details of the most expensive instrument, 
sorting instruments by price, and filtering instruments by family. 
This workshop provided a practical application of Java concepts such as object-oriented programming, streams, and collections.

Objectives: 

Receive the price value for each instrument:
The application prompts the user to input the price of various musical instruments, which are then stored for further processing.

Display the most expensive instrument:
The application identifies and displays details of the most expensive instrument, including how to play it, how to fix it, and its pitch type.

Display instruments in descending order of price:
The application sorts and displays the list of instruments in descending order based on their prices.

Display sounds of instruments by family:
The application allows the user to input an instrument family name and displays the sounds made by instruments belonging to that family.
Implementation

To achieve these objectives, the project was divided into several classes:

InstrumentModel: This class stores an array of musical instruments and provides getter and setter methods.
InstrumentController: This class contains methods to interact with the InstrumentModel, including displaying the most expensive instrument, sorting instruments by price, and filtering instruments by family.
Main: This class contains the main method, which serves as the entry point for the application. It handles user input and invokes the appropriate methods from the InstrumentController.
